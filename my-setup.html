								<h2>Current Laptop</h2>
								<p>I've got a <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/yoga/500-series/Yoga-510-14-Intel/p/88YG5000788">Lenovo Yoga 510</a> with the following stats:</p>

								<p>It's definitely not <i>bad</i>, but it's also not the fastest; it's undoubtedly bloated up with Windows and Lenovo <i>stuff</i> and it gets unbelievably noisy with the smallest of loads.
								Sure, I could probably strip it back (again), maybe take it apart and clean the fan etc, but it's a good excuse to get something newer and more powerful.</p>
								<p>I'll probably hang on to it when I get a replacement - I'd like to bung a Linux OS onto it - but I'm keen to hit the post-Christmas sales and upgrade!
								If you know a bit about laptops and want to help me out, drop me a line through my socials - I'd really appreciate it!</p>
								<br>
								<h2>Options</h2>
								<p>It's probably worth starting with what I use my laptop for <i>(everything, because I don't have a desktop PC...)</i>:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Normal work-type stuff:</b> Office 365, Internet, Reading etc;</li>
									<li><b>General social stuff:</b> Internet, WhatsApp etc;</li>
									<li><b>Programming <sup>1</sup> :</b> Everything from small helpful scripts to bigger projects, data analysis etc;</li>
									<li><b>Development <sup>2</sup> :</b> Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Breadboards, Networked Machines etc;</li>
									<li><b>Gaming:</b> At the moment, I can run the likes of Age of Empires (the originals) and GTA San Andreas.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><sup>1</sup> I <i>heavily</i> use VSCode, Git, GitHub Desktop, Arduino IDE, MU, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</a>.<br>
								<sup>2</sup> Most of this doesn't necessarily require a powerful machine, but it's useful to know what I use my laptop for. Additionally, I'd like to stick with a built-in SD Card reader if possible - it makes working with RPis so much easier!</p>
								<p>I host all of my documents etc on OneDrive and all of programming projects on GitHub*, so the internal storage is pretty much all for the system and software. If I ever need to take stuff with me locally (ie if I won't have internet access), I have a collection of USB drives and external HDDs to fall back on.</p>
								<p>So, what am I thinking about?</p>

								<p>With an AMOLED 4K Ultra HD (3840 x 2160p) anti-reflection touch screen and B&O speakers, this sounds like it would be a pleasure to work on. I actually checked one out in-store and was pleasantly surprised by the size, look and feel of it, as well as by the full size keyboard (I like having a proper Numpad).</p>
								<p>I've got a few reservations about it though: the lack of ports (especially USB, which feels like a restrictive oversight) and the near Â£2k price-tag make me wonder if I'd be paying over-the-odds for a machine with less flexibility that I need. I <i>do</i> like that it comes with a stylus, but does that make up for the other concerns? Not really.</p>
